Project I
Your task is to create a desktop application, that combines 2 parts:

Painting module
Module consists of main window, which generates primitive shaped elements (ellipses, rectangles, triangles, etc.) with different colors, locations and dimensions.

At constant intervals, there is a new element added (drawn), which values are pseudorandom. The element has to have a proper location and dimension, so it fits in the window.

Resizing a window is followed by rescaling all drawn elements.

Program has to save information about generated shapes to a file.

Displaying module
It consists of a window, which reads information about shapes from a file and draws them in the window. Generated image has to be the same as the one generated by painting module.

Resizing a window is followed by rescaling all drawn elements.

Additional description
Modules are understood as two parts of an application. It does not implicate necessity of using modules or packages available by Java language.

Format of a saved file is determined by a student. One cannot use “Object Streams” classes.
